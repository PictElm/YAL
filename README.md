# YAL

YAL (YourAnimeList) is a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot which intent is to provide quick access to [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) ("MAL"). It relies on the JS version of the [Jikan](https://jikan.moe/) API.

## Commands

To get YAL to respond, you want to start your message with `"yal,"` (case insensitive) then follow with the desired command.

> yal, c-kwa O.P.M.?

YAL only supports so many commands, as of right now:

1. `"c-kwa"`: if YAL know this term he will return its translation (from _weeb_ to _humain_) else he will ask in its turn what this is so you can make it learn.
0. `"c-ou"`: YAL goes through the pain of looking-up MAL for an anime name you provided, then it sends a link. If this is not what you where looking for, you can anser `"non"` to get 5 other names.
